cobalt News and Updates

Version 3.4.0

* Added `default` method for `bal.tab` so it can be used with specially formatted output from other packages (e.g., from `optweight`). `bal.plot` should work with these outputs too. This, of course, will never be completely bug-free because infinite inputs are possible and cannot all be processed perfectly. Don't try to break this function :)

* Fixed some bugs occuring when standardized mean differences are not finite, thanks to No√©mie Kiefer.

* Speed improvements in `bal.plot`, especially with multiple facets, and in `bal.tab`.

* Added new options to `bal.plot`, including the ability to display histograms rather than densities and mirrored rather than overlapping plots. This makes it possible to make the popular mirrored histogram plot for propensity scores. In addition, it's now easier to change the colors of the components of the plots.

* Made behavior around binary variables with interactions more like documentation, where interactions with both levels of the variable are present (thanks to @victorn1). Also, replaced `_` with ` * ` as the delimiter between variable names in interactions. For the old behavior, use the "secret" option `int_sep = "_"` in `bal.tab`. This functionality is not documented (mostly because I'm lazy).

* Expanded the flexibility of `var.names` in `love.plot` so that replacing the name of a variable will replace it everywhere it appears, including interactions. Thanks to @victorn1 for the suggestion.

* Added `var.names` function to extract and save variable names from `bal.tab` objects. This makes it a lot easier to create replacement names for use in `love.plot`. Thanks to @victorn1 for the suggestion.

* When weighted correlations are computed for continuous treatments, the denominator of the correlation uses the unweighted standard deviations. See `?bal.tab` for the rationale.

Version 3.3.0

* Added methods for objects from the `designmatch` package.

* Added methods for `ps.cont` objects from the `WeightIt` package.

* Fixed bugs resulting form changes to how formula inputs are handled.

* Cleaned up some internal functions, also fixing some related bugs

* Added `subset` option in all `bal.tab()` methods (and consequently in `bal.plot()`) that allows users to specify a subset of the data to assess balance on (i.e., instead of the whole data set). This provides a workaround for methods were the `cluster` option isn't allowed (e.g., longitudinal treatments) but balance is desired on subsets of the data. However, in most cases, `cluster` with `which.cluster` specified makes more sense.

* Updated help files, in particularly more clearly documenting methods for `iptw` objects from `twang` and `CBMSM` objects from `CBPS`.

* Added pretty printing with `crayon`, inspired by Jacob Long's `jtools` package

* Added `abs` option to `bal.tab` to display absolute values of statistics, which can be especially helpful for aggregated output. This also affects how `love.plot()` handles aggregated balance statistics.

Version 3.2.3

* Added support for data with missing covariates. `bal.tab()` will produce balanace statistics for the non-missing values and will automatically create a new variable indicating whether the variable is missing or not and produce balance statistics on this variable as well. 

* Fixed a bug when displaying maximum imbalances with subclassification.

* Fixed a bug where the unadjusted statistics were not displayed when using `love.plot()` with subclasses. (Thanks to Megha Joshi.)

* Add the ability to display individual subclass balance using `love.plot()` with subclasses.

* Under-the-hood changes to how `weightit` objects are handled.

* Objects in the environment are now handled better by `bal.tab()` with the formula interface. The `data` argument is now optional if all variables in the formula exist in the environment.

Version 3.2.2

* Fixed a bug when using `get.w()` (and `bal.tab()`) with `mnps` objects from `twang` with only one stop method.

* Fixed a bug when using `bal.tab()` with `twang` objects that contained missing covariate values.

* Fixed a bug when using `int = TRUE` in `bal.tab()` with few covariates.

* Fixed a bug when variable names had special characters.

* Added ablity to check higher order polynomials by setting `int` to a number.

* Changed behavior of `bal.tab()` with multinomial treatments and `s.d.denom = "pooled"` to use the pooled standard deviation from the entire sample, not just the paired treatments.

* Restored some vignettes that required `WeightIt`.

Version 3.2.1

* Edits to vignettes and help files to respond to missing packages. Some vignette items may not display if packages are (temporarily) unavailable.

* Fixed issue with sampling weights in `CBPS` objects. (Thanks to @kkranker on Github.)

* Added more support for sampling weights in `get.w()` and help files.

Version 3.2.0

* Added support for longitudinal treatments in `bal.tab()`, `bal.plot()`, and `love.plot()`, including output from `iptw()` in `twang`, `CBMSM()` from `CBPS`, and `weightitMSM()` from `WeightIt`.

* Added a vignette to explain use with longitudinal treatments.

* Edits to help files.

* Added ability to change density options in `bal.plot()`.

* Added support for `imp` in `bal.tab()` for `weightit` objects.

* Fixed bugs when limited variables were present. (One found and fixed by @sumtxt on Github.)

* Fixed bug with multiple methods when weights were entered as a list.

Version 3.1.0

* Added full support for tibbles.

* Examples for `weightit` methods in documentation and vignette now work.

* Improved speed and performance.

* Added `pairwise` option for `bal.tab()` with multinomial treatments.

* Increased flexibility for displaying balance using `love.plot()` with clustered or multiply imputed data.

* Added `imbalanced.only` and `disp.bal.tab` options to `bal.tab()`.

* Fixes to the vignettes. Also, creation of a new vignette to simplify the main one.

Version 3.0.0

* Added support for multinomial treatments in `bal.tab()`, including output from `CBPS` and `twang`.

* Added support for `weightit` objects from `WeightIt`, including for multinomial treatments.

* Added support for `ebalance.trim` objects from `ebal`.

* Fixes to the vignette.

* Fixes to `splitfactor()` to handle tibbles better. 

* Fixed bug when using `bal.tab()` with multiply imputed data without adjustment. Fixed bug when using `s.weights` with the `formula` method of `bal.tab()`.

Version 2.2.0

* Added `disp.ks` and `ks.threshold` options to `bal.tab()` to display Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics before and after preprocessing.

* Added support for sampling weights, which are applied to both control and treated units, using option `s.weights` in `bal.tab()`. Sampling weights are also now compatible with the sampling weights in `ps` objects from `twang`; the default is to apply the sampling weights before and after adjustment, mimicking the behavior of `bal.table()` in `twang`.

* Changed behavior of `bal.tab()` for `ps` objects to allow displaying balance for more than one stop method at a time, and to default to displaying balance for all available stop methods. The `full.stop.method` argument in `bal.tab()` has been renamed `stop.method`, but `full.stop.method` still works. `get.w()` for `ps` objects has also gone through some changes to be more like `twang`'s `get.weights()`.

* Added support in `bal.tab()` and `bal.plot()` for subclassification with continuous treatments.

* Added support in `splitfactor()` and `unsplitfactor()` for `NA` values

* Fixed a bug in `love.plot()` caused when `var.order` was specified to be a sample that was not present.

* Added support in `bal.tab()`, `bal.plot()`, and `love.plot()` for examining balance on multiple weight specifications at a time

* Added new utilities `splitfactor()`, `unsplitfactor()`, and `get.w()`

* Added option in `bal.plot()` to display points sized by weights when treatment and covariate are continuous

* Added `which = "both"` option in `bal.plot()` to simultaneously display plots for both adjusted and unadjusted samples; changed argument syntax to accommodate

* Allowed `bal.plot()` to display balance for mutliple clusters and imputations simultaneously

* Allowed `bal.plot()` to display balance for mutliple subclasses simultaneously with `which.sub`

* Fixes to `love.plot()` to ensure adjusted points are in front of unadjusted points; changed colors and shape defaults and allowable values

* Fixed bug where `s.d.denom` and `estimand` were not functioning correctly in `bal.tab()`

* `distance`, `addl`, and `weights` can now be specified as lists of the usual arguments

* Added full support (`bal.tab()`, `love.plot()`, and `bal.plot()`) for multiply imputed data, including for clustered data sets.

* Added support for multiple distance measures, including special treatment in `love.plot()`

* Adjusted specifications in `love.plot()` for color and shape of points, and added option to generate a line connecting the points.

* Adjusted `love.plot()` display to perform better on Windows.

* Added capabilties for `love.plot()` and `bal.plot()` to display plots for multiple groups at a time

* Added flexibility to `f.build()`.
